        <h2 id="1-background">1. Background</h2>
        <p>Fault diagnosis of industrial rotating machinery (e.g., gearboxes, bearings) usually relies on vibration signal analysis. A large amount of background noise exists in actual operating environments, causing the weak signals in the early stages of faults to be easily masked.</p>
        <p>When processing highly noised signals, traditional deep learning models (such as CNNs and ResNets) are prone to extracting noise interference as features, which leads to a decrease in diagnostic accuracy. Deep Residual Shrinkage Networks (DRSN) were proposed to address this issue. This method introduces the soft thresholding mechanism from traditional signal processing into deep neural networks as a nonlinear transformation layer to eliminate noise-related features and improve the model's feature learning capability in highly noisy environments.</p>

        <h2 id="2-core-mechanism">2. Core Mechanism</h2>
        <p>The core idea of DRSN is to integrate a sub-module inside the residual building block of ResNet that can automatically calculate the threshold and perform feature shrinkage.</p>

        <h3 id="21-soft-thresholding">2.1 Soft Thresholding</h3>
        <p>Soft thresholding is a classic method in signal denoising (such as wavelet denoising). Its basic mathematical logic is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set features with absolute values less than a specific threshold to zero.</li>
            <li>Shrink features with absolute values greater than the threshold towards zero (i.e., subtract the set threshold).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Through soft thresholding, the model can eliminate noise features close to zero while retaining key fault features with large absolute values. Since its derivative is always 1 in the non-zero region, it also has the effect of preventing gradient vanishing.</p>

        <div align="center">

        <h3 id="22-adaptive-threshold-sub-network">2.2 Adaptive Threshold Calculation Sub-network</h3>
        <p>Traditional signal processing methods usually rely on expert experience to manually set thresholds and cannot adapt to the layer-by-layer varying feature distributions in neural networks. DRSN designs a specific sub-network to automatically learn and determine the soft threshold via gradient descent algorithms.</p>
        <p>The calculation flow is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Global Feature Extraction:</strong> Take the absolute value of the input feature map and perform Global Average Pooling (GAP) to compress it into a 1D vector.</li>
            <li><strong>Scaling Parameter Generation:</strong> Input this 1D vector into a two-layer Fully Connected (FC) network and apply the Sigmoid activation function to output a scaling parameter in the range of (0, 1).</li>
            <li><strong>Threshold Calculation:</strong> Multiply the generated scaling parameter by the average absolute value of the input features to obtain the final threshold.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This mechanism ensures that the threshold is always positive and will not be greater than the maximum absolute value of the features. At the same time, each input vibration signal sample can dynamically generate an exclusive threshold according to its own noise level.</p>

        <h2 id="3-network-variants">3. Network Variants</h2>
        <p>Based on the strategy of applying thresholds to the feature map channels, the paper proposes two specific network architectures:</p>

        <h3 id="31-drsn-cs">3.1 DRSN-CS (Channel-Shared Thresholds)</h3>
        <p>In the DRSN-CS structure, all channels of the feature map share the same soft threshold. This method requires relatively less computational overhead and is suitable for scenarios where noise distribution across channels is relatively uniform.</p>

        <div align="center">

        </div>

        <h3 id="32-drsn-cw">3.2 DRSN-CW (Channel-Wise Thresholds)</h3>
        <p>In the DRSN-CW structure, the number of output neurons of the fully connected network is equal to the number of channels of the feature map. This means each channel will calculate an independent scaling parameter, resulting in independent thresholds. Because different convolutional channels typically contain varying degrees of noise information, channel-wise thresholding is more flexible and theoretically possesses stronger denoising and feature screening capabilities.</p>

        <h2 id="4-experimental-conclusions">4. Experimental Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The paper collected 8 types of state data, including health states, bearing faults, and gear faults, through a planetary gearbox transmission system fault diagnosis simulator.</p>
        <p>Under the conditions of artificially adding Gaussian noise, Laplacian noise, and Pink noise with different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR from 5dB to -5dB), DRSN demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. Experimental data show that the testing accuracies of DRSN-CS and DRSN-CW, which introduced the adaptive soft thresholding mechanism, were significantly higher than those of traditional CNN and ResNet. Among them, DRSN-CW achieved slightly higher overall diagnostic accuracy than DRSN-CS due to its finer shrinkage control capability over features in different channels.</p>
        <p>Visualization results also confirmed that the high-level features extracted by DRSN exhibited higher intra-class aggregation and more distinct inter-class separability in a 2D space.</p>
